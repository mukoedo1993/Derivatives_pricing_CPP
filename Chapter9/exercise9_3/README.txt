Q:Write a routine to price a vanilla option by Monte Carlo or trees where the pay-off is passed
in as a template parameter expressed via a function.

Tips: I kept only SimpleMC8.h but discard SimpleMC.cpp. 
Also, I changed some codes in RandomMain3.cpp file so that Monte_Carlo function shows the template.
