In this chapter, we can use a wrapper class to hide all the memory handling, allowing us to treat 
a polymorphic object just like any other object, which increases our codes' portability and adheres to
the principle of open-and-close(Do not modify most, if not all, existent files. Allow client to add new features
by adding new files.)


See Subdirectories for more details.
