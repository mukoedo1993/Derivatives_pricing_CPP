/*
*
*To illustrate certain aspects of tree pricing, we price the European call, the American
* call and the forward. We then reprice them using one extra step. The reason we do this
* is that often pricing on trees gives rise to a zig-zag behavior as nodes go above and below
* the money. The average of the price for two successive steps is therefore often a lot more
* accurate than a single price. We give the comparison Black-Scholes price for the European option
* as an assessment of accuracy. The code for the Black-Scholes price is in BlackScholesFormula.h
* and BlackScholesFormula.cpp; 
*
*
*/

/*
* A standard way of improving the accuracy of American option pricing is to use the European price
* as a control. As we know the true price of the European and we know the tree price also, we
*can assume that the American option has the same amount of error as the European and adjust its price accordingly....
*
*

/*
* We also give the price of a forward. Note that if we had required the discounted discretized process
* to be a martingale, then the forward would be priced absolutely correctly;
