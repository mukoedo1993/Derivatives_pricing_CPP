Compared to case2_ver1, I only made some small changes.
I replaced the method given by the author to generate normal distribution with a STL normal enigine.
That's all. The wrapper class is too delicate to tolerate the rewriting from raw pointers to smart_ptrs....
:( So sad. several hours wasted...
