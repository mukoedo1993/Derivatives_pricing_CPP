 A key part of our factory was the singleton, and a key part of the singletonwas the 
 fact that it could not be copied. We achieved this by making all the constructors including
 the copy constructor private. 

 The key observation that makes this technique work is that if a class has a private copy constructor or assignment operator,
 then any class inherited from it cannot be copied or assigned either, since the inherited class implicitly
 holds a base class object.

 Here's the important part of the relevant file from Boost.

 "boost/noncopyable.hpp"
//https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_53_0/boost/noncopyable.hpp
 class noncopyable
 {
protected:
    noncopyable(){}
    ~noncopyable(){}

private:    // emphasize the following members are private
    noncopyable(const noncopyable&)=delete
    const noncopyable& operator= (const noncopyable& ); 
 }

 The class is very small and has no data members. Its constructor and destructor are protected
 to ensure that it can only be constructed by an inherited class. The copy constructor and assignment 
 operator are, of course, private to ensure that even inherited classes cannot make a copy.

 To use this class we simply inherit our new class from it. For example, a typical use would be:

 class MySingleton : private noncopyable
 {
    ...
 };


Tips:
1: Oops... But C++11 gives us a much better way: define it deleted.
