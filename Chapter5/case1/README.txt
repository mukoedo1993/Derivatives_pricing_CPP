Designing a statistics gatherer:
What should the routine do? 
It must have two principal methods. The first should take in data for each path.
The second must output the desired statistics.

Our first method, DumpOneResult, we make quite simple: it takes in a double and returns nothing.
Our second method, which will indeed return the resultsm requires a little more thought. We have to decise
what sort of object to return the results in.
