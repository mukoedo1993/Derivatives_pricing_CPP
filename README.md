# Target
Read and rewrite the code given in the book above as much as possible in modern C++ style. 
And, give the solution of questions given in the textbook as many as possible.

# Platform:
Ubuntu 20.04.1
g++ 9.3.0
If there is a Makefile in a certain directory, use it.
Otherwise, I will give a direction on how to organize and compile the code in the README.txt file in its directory.

6:... See README.txt at each directory. Bascially, you could run 
make on ubuntu to run files in each directory when a Makefile is given. However, sometimes, you need to type files manually if 
you could not find a Makefile here.
