Q: Interface the Boost random number classes with the path-dependent exotic option developed here. 
(exercise12_2: )

I only made some small change in the ParkMiller.cpp file. So the boost/random.hpp's functions could be used.
Admittedly, we could convenient find all boost functions involved with this question in the std C++11 lib.
