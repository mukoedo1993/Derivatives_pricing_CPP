One alternative method is therefore to use a convergence table. Rather than returning statistics for the
entire simulation, we instead return them for every power of two to get an idea of how the numbers are varying. We
could just write a class directly to return such a table for the mean, but since we might want to do this for any 
statistic, we do it in a reusable fashion. 

Our class must contain a statistics gatherer in order to decide for which statistics to create a convergence table. On
the other hand, it must implement the same interface as all the other statistics gatherers so we can plug it into the same
simulations. We therefore define a class ConvergenceTable which is inherited from Statistics,C amd has a wrapper of an StatisticsMC object 
as a data member.
