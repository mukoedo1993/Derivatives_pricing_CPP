I kept most of codes, except some details,such as minmax.h.
It gives a pseudo-random-number generator which could except exactly same results from 
different implementations.

Actually, if we used built-in random number generators, then we might obtain different results in 
different implementations. It will cause some tricky problems on its reusability.
