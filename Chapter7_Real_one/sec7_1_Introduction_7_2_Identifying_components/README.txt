We can therefore identify four distinct actions:
(1): The generation of the stock price path.
(2): the generation of cash-flows given a stock price path.
(3): the discounting and summing of cash-flows for a given path.
(4): the averaging of the prices over all the paths.


----> What its pay-off is. 


If we decide to do jump-diffusion pricing or stochastic interest rates, this class will be reusable without
modification, and that would not be the case if we had included information about interest rates or volatility.

Two remaining tasks:

1: path generation 

2: cash-flow accounting.
