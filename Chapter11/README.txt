Creational patterns:
A creational pattern is a pattern that deals primarily with the creation of new objects. Their purpose is to abstract the creation process 
which helps the system to be developed independently of the types of individual objects. In fact, sometimes all we can be sure of about these objects, is what
class they are inherited from, or in other terms what interface they implement.
1: Virtual Copy Constructor
2: The factory
3: The singleton
4: The Monostate

Structural patterns:
1: Adapter
2: Bridge
3: Decorator

Behavioural patterns:
4: Strategy
In the strategy pattern, we defer an important part of algorithm to an inputted object. 
This allows us to easily change how this particular part of the algorithm behaves.

5:Template
6: Iterator
